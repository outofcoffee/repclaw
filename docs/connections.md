# Connections and backends

A connection is a saved target lucinate can connect to (URL + type + auth identity). The list is persisted to `~/.lucinate/connections.json` and managed through the connections picker (`viewConnections`) — accessible as the entry view on first run, via `/connections` mid-session, or via the **Connections** action on the agent picker.

## Connection types

Two backend types ship today; both implement `backend.Backend` (`internal/backend/backend.go`) so the chat / sessions / commands views are backend-agnostic.

| Type      | URL shape                              | Auth                                   | Agent storage                 |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| OpenClaw  | `https://`/`http://`/`wss://`/`ws://` (WS endpoint derived) | Ed25519 device pairing                 | Server-side on the gateway   |
| OpenAI    | `http(s)://host/v1`                    | Optional `Authorization: Bearer <key>` | Local — see [agent storage](#openai-agent-storage) below |

`AllConnectionTypes` (`internal/config/connections.go`) drives the picker form's type radio. Adding a third backend means: implementing `backend.Backend`, extending the enum, dispatching in `backendFactory` (`main.go`), and adjusting the form's type-conditional rendering.

## Startup decision tree

`config.ResolveEntryConnection()` (`internal/config/startup.go`) decides what the TUI's entry view is:

1. If `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` is set, find or auto-add a matching OpenClaw connection.
2. Else if `LUCINATE_OPENAI_BASE_URL` is set, find or auto-add a matching OpenAI connection (with `LUCINATE_OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL` if provided).
3. Else if a saved `defaultId` resolves to a known entry → use it (last-used = default).
4. Else if exactly one connection is stored → auto-pick it.
5. Else → open the connections picker.

Auto-add (steps 1–2) mutates the in-memory store but does **not** persist it until a successful connect, so a typo in the env URL doesn't accumulate ghost entries.

## Connection lifecycle

The TUI owns the lifecycle in managed mode (`AppOptions.Store != nil`):

- A successful connect calls `OnBackendChanged(backend)` so the app driver in `app/app.go` rewires the events pump and supervisor onto the new backend.
- Picking a different connection mid-session (`/connections`, the picker action, or any other `showConnectionsMsg`) publishes `nil` to the driver, which closes the active backend before binding to whatever the next pick produces.
- The driver owns Close — TUI code never closes the backend itself once it's published.

Legacy mode (`AppOptions.Backend != nil`, no `Store`) is for native-platform embedders that manage the connection elsewhere; the connections picker and `/connections` are unavailable, and Close is the caller's responsibility.

## Capability negotiation

`backend.Backend.Capabilities()` reports a `Capabilities` struct (`internal/backend/backend.go`); the TUI type-asserts against optional sub-interfaces (`StatusBackend`, `ExecBackend`, `CompactBackend`, `ThinkingBackend`, `UsageBackend`, `DeviceTokenAuth`, `APIKeyAuth`) at the relevant call sites. OpenClaw implements all of them. OpenAI implements only `APIKeyAuth` — backend-only commands (`/status`, `/compact`, `/think`, `/stats`, `!!`) render a "not available on this connection" system message instead of erroring.

## Auth-recovery modals

`Connect` errors are routed into modal sub-states by the connecting view (`internal/tui/connecting.go`):

- `gateway token mismatch` → device-token modal: clear / reset identity / cancel. `ClearToken` and `ResetIdentity` come from `DeviceTokenAuth`.
- `gateway token missing` → device-token text prompt; submission stores via `DeviceTokenAuth.StoreToken`.
- `api key required` (HTTP 401/403 from any `/v1` request) → API-key text prompt; submission stores via `APIKeyAuth.StoreAPIKey`.

The submission flow dispatches on `connectingModel.authNeed` rather than on Go interface assertion: the OpenClaw wrapper implements both `DeviceTokenAuth` and `APIKeyAuth`, so a naive type-switch would always pick the first arm. See `connecting.go` `case "enter":` for the dispatch.

## OpenAI agent storage

OpenAI-compat connections store agents on disk because the `/v1` shape has no agent concept. Each agent owns a directory under `~/.lucinate/agents/<connection-id>/<agent-id>/` containing:

| File           | Purpose                                                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `agent.json`   | Metadata: id, name, default model, created/updated timestamps |
| `IDENTITY.md`  | Who the agent is (markdown — user-editable)                   |
| `SOUL.md`      | Tone / values / working style (markdown — user-editable)      |
| `history.jsonl`| Append-only transcript, one JSON message per line             |

`AgentStore.SystemPrompt(agentID)` (`internal/backend/openai/agents.go`) concatenates IDENTITY.md and SOUL.md at runtime to form the system prompt, so a user can edit either file between sessions without going through the TUI. Defaults seed the create form (`DefaultIdentity`, `DefaultSoul`) for rapid agent creation.

Agent ≡ session 1:1 on this backend — there's no session browser sub-list, the agent ID *is* the session key. `/reset` clears `history.jsonl` (via `SessionDelete`); the agent itself stays.

## Secrets storage

API keys live at `~/.lucinate/secrets/secrets.json` (mode 0600), keyed by connection ID. `config.GetAPIKey(connID)` and `config.SetAPIKey(connID, key)` are the public surface. `LUCINATE_OPENAI_API_KEY` falls back when no per-connection key is stored.

The `secretAwareBackend` shim in `main.go` wraps `*openai.Backend` so `StoreAPIKey` writes through to disk during the auth-modal resolution path; the next launch reuses the key without re-prompting.

A future enhancement is to back this with the OS keychain (Keychain on macOS, libsecret on Linux, Credential Manager on Windows) and fall back to the JSON file when no keychain is available — kept on disk for now to avoid platform-specific dependencies on first run.

## Connections form

`internal/tui/connections.go` implements the picker. The form has a fixed type radio plus type-conditional fields:

| Type     | Fields                                       |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| OpenClaw | Type, Name, Gateway URL                      |
| OpenAI   | Type, Name, Base URL, Default model (optional) |

Tab cycles through the visible fields only. ←/→ on the type radio cycles through `AllConnectionTypes`; the URL placeholder updates to match the selected type. Edit forms drop the radio entirely (type is immutable post-create) and start focus on the name field.

Delete confirmation is exposed as a sub-state with confirm/cancel pairs in `Actions()`, so native-platform embedders render them as buttons rather than relying on inline `y/n` keys.
