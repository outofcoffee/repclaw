// or build a *Program directly when they need to send window-size updates
// or request a quit from another goroutine.

	// InitialCols and InitialRows seed the program with a window-size
	// message before its first render. Embedders that drive a fixed-size
	// virtual terminal (e.g. an in-process renderer) should set these so
	// the first paint already fits the visible grid; otherwise Bubble Tea
	// renders against its default size and reflows on the first
	// post-layout WindowSizeMsg, which can leave stale characters on
	// screen until the next full repaint.
	InitialCols int

	// ColorProfile, when non-zero, overrides Bubble Tea's automatic
	// colour-profile detection. Bubble Tea inspects Output to decide
	// what palette Lipgloss is allowed to emit; when Output is not a
	// real TTY (an in-process virtual terminal driven by an embedder,
	// say) the auto-detected profile is NoTTY, which strips every SGR
	// sequence and produces a monochrome render. Embedders whose
	// terminal supports colour should set this to the appropriate
	// profile (typically colorprofile.TrueColor). The CLI leaves it
	// zero so its existing detection still applies.
	ColorProfile colorprofile.Profile

	// HideInputArea suppresses the chat view's textarea so the embedder
	// can supply its own input surface (for example, a platform-native
	// text field whose typed bytes are written into Input). The
	// underlying textarea model is still updated by the incoming byte
	// stream so command parsing, slash-command autocomplete, history,
	// and Enter-to-send behave exactly as in the CLI; only the textarea
	// view and its border are skipped, and the help line below
	// continues to surface slash-command hints. The CLI never needs
	// this; embedders without a separate input surface should leave it
	// false.
	HideInputArea bool

	// HideActionHints suppresses the inline help line each view renders
	// listing its action keys ("  n: new agent · r: retry"). Embedders
	// that surface the same actions through OnActionsChanged as native
	// controls (buttons, toolbar items) want this true so the hint text
	// isn't doubled up on screen. The CLI, whose only action surface is
	// the inline hint, leaves it false.
	HideActionHints bool

	// DisableMouse stops the program from emitting the
	// alt-screen mouse-tracking enable sequence. Embedders driving the
	// program through a virtual terminal whose host wants to handle
	// pan/swipe gestures natively (translating them into PgUp/PgDown
	// keystrokes for example) should set this so the host's gesture
	// recogniser doesn't capture pans into mouse motion events that the
	// program then ignores. The CLI relies on mouse tracking for
	// selection and should leave it false.
	DisableMouse bool

	// OnInputFocusChanged, if non-nil, is invoked whenever the active
	// view's preferred input mode changes. wantsInput is true when the
	// active view has a focused free-form text input (the chat
	// textarea, the new-agent form fields) and false when only
	// navigation keys are expected (the agent list, the session
	// browser, the config view). The callback fires once during start-up
	// with the initial state so the embedder need not assume a default,
	// and again on every subsequent transition.
	//
	// Embedders on platforms with an on-screen keyboard use this to
	// surface it only when the program actually wants typing, instead
	// of pinning it permanently and losing screen real estate. The
	// callback runs from a tea.Cmd goroutine — embedders that touch UI
	// on a main thread should trampoline accordingly. The CLI leaves
	// it nil.
	OnInputFocusChanged func(wantsInput bool)

	// OnActionsChanged, if non-nil, is invoked whenever the active
	// view's set of exposed Actions changes. The active view is the
	// authoritative source of its discoverable, view-level commands
	// (e.g. "new agent", "back", "retry"); the desktop TUI renders
	// these as inline help and dispatches the bound key, while
	// embedders typically render them as buttons whose tap calls back
	// in via Program.TriggerAction.
	//
	// The callback fires once at start-up with the initial list and
