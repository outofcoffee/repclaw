# Integration Testing

End-to-end integration tests that run repclaw against a real OpenClaw gateway
backed by a local Ollama model. The LLM runs on the host (Metal-accelerated),
while the gateway runs in Docker.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement       | Install                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Docker Desktop    | https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ |
| Ollama            | `brew install ollama`            |
| jq                | `brew install jq`                |
| Go 1.22+          | https://go.dev/dl/               |

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Set up the environment (pulls model, starts gateway, pairs device)
make test-integration-setup

# 2. Run integration tests
make test-integration

# 3. Tear down when done
make test-integration-teardown
```

## What `setup.sh` does

1. **Checks prerequisites** — Docker, Ollama, jq, Go.
2. **Starts Ollama** if it isn't already running.
3. **Pulls the test model** (`qwen3.5:9b` by default — fast on Apple Silicon).
4. **Starts the OpenClaw gateway** in Docker via `docker-compose.yml`.
5. **Pairs the local device** using this flow:
   - Seeds the gateway token as the device token for the first connect.
   - Connects once to register the device (rejected with `NOT_PAIRED` — expected).
   - Approves the pending device via `openclaw devices approve <requestId>`.
   - Rotates the device token via `openclaw devices rotate` to get a proper credential.
   - Verifies the connection with the new device token.
6. **Writes `.env`** with `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:18789`.

After setup, the device identity at `~/.openclaw-go/identity/` is paired with
the test gateway. If you had an existing device token (from a production
gateway), it is backed up to `device-token.backup` and restored on teardown.

## What `teardown.sh` does

1. Stops and removes the gateway container.
2. Removes the gateway state directory (`test/integration/state/`).
3. Restores any backed-up device token.

## Docker setup notes

The gateway container runs as the host user (`OPENCLAW_UID`/`OPENCLAW_GID`) so
that the bind-mounted `./state/` directory is writable. Two environment
variables are required for this to work:

- `HOME: /home/node` — the container image doesn't have a `/etc/passwd` entry
  for the host UID, so Docker defaults `$HOME` to `/`. Setting it explicitly
  points the gateway at its expected config directory.
- `npm_config_cache: /tmp/npm-cache` — the image ships with a root-owned
  `/home/node/.npm` cache from the build step. Running as a non-root user
  would make plugin dep installs fail with `EACCES`. Redirecting npm's cache
  to `/tmp` avoids this.

## Choosing a different model

```bash
MODEL=qwen3.5:35b make test-integration-setup
```

| Model | Size | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `qwen3.5:4b` | 3.4 GB | Fastest iteration |
| `qwen3.5:9b` | 6.6 GB | **Default** — good balance on Apple Silicon |
| `qwen3.5:27b` | 17 GB | Higher quality |
| `qwen3.5:35b` | 24 GB | Best quality on 32 GB machines — fits with ~8 GB to spare |

To switch the model permanently (not just for one setup run), update these three
places in addition to re-running setup:

1. **`test/integration/openclaw.json`** — `models.providers.ollama.models[0].id`
   and `agents.defaults.model.primary` (use `ollama/<model>` for the routing key)
2. **`test/integration/setup.sh`** — the `MODEL` default at the top of the file
3. **`test/integration/state/openclaw.json`** — the live copy used by the running
   gateway (or just re-run `make test-integration-setup` to regenerate it)

## Running specific tests

```bash
# Run a single integration test
go test -tags integration -run TestQueueOrdering ./internal/tui/ -v -count=1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway won't start

```bash
docker compose -f test/integration/docker-compose.yml logs gateway
```

### Device pairing fails

The setup script runs the full register → approve → rotate flow. If it fails,
you can step through it manually:

```bash
GW_URL="ws://127.0.0.1:18789/ws"
GW_TOKEN="repclaw-integration-test"
COMPOSE="test/integration/docker-compose.yml"

# 1. List pending devices (JSON structure: {"pending":[...], "paired":[...]})
docker compose -f "$COMPOSE" exec -T gateway \
    openclaw devices list --json --token "$GW_TOKEN" --url "$GW_URL"

# 2. Approve the pending device using its requestId
docker compose -f "$COMPOSE" exec -T gateway \
    openclaw devices approve <requestId> --token "$GW_TOKEN" --url "$GW_URL"

# 3. Rotate to get a proper device token (use the deviceId from step 1)
docker compose -f "$COMPOSE" exec -T gateway \
    openclaw devices rotate --device <deviceId> --role operator \
    --scope operator.read --scope operator.write \
    --scope operator.admin --scope operator.approvals \
    --json --token "$GW_TOKEN" --url "$GW_URL"

# 4. Save the returned .token value
echo -n "<token>" > ~/.openclaw-go/identity/device-token
```

### Ollama not reachable from Docker

Ensure Docker Desktop has "Allow the default Docker socket to be used" enabled
and that `host.docker.internal` resolves correctly:

```bash
docker run --rm --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway alpine \
    wget -qO- http://host.docker.internal:11434/api/tags
```

### Tests are slow or non-deterministic

This is expected with a real LLM. Integration tests should assert on protocol
structure (message ordering, event types, session lifecycle) rather than on
response content. Keep LLM-dependent assertions to smoke-test level.
