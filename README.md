## What it does

repclaw is the terminal-native client for OpenClaw. Connect to your gateway, pick an agent, and start chatting. Responses stream in live, messages render as markdown, and you never need to reach for the mouse.

No file browsers, no task boards, no dashboards. Just chat.

### Highlights

- **Chat with your OpenClaw agents** from the terminal, with streaming responses, conversation history, and multi-agent support
- **Create agents** directly from the TUI
- **Markdown rendering** for assistant messages
- **Remote command execution** on the gateway host via `!` prefix
- **Message queueing** so you can keep typing while the agent is responding
- **Local agent skills** loaded from `~/.agents/skills/` as slash commands
- **Live token/cost stats** in the header bar

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outofcoffee/repclaw/main/install/repclaw.sh | sh
```

Or, if you have Go 1.24+:

```sh
go install github.com/outofcoffee/repclaw@latest
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/outofcoffee/repclaw.git
cd repclaw
go build -o repclaw .
```

## Getting started

### 1. Configure repclaw

Create a `.env` file in the directory you'll run repclaw from (or export the variable in your shell):

```sh
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-gateway-host
```

The gateway URL can use `https`, `http`, `wss`, or `ws` schemes. repclaw derives the WebSocket endpoint automatically.

### 2. Connect and approve the device

```sh
repclaw
```

On first run, repclaw generates an Ed25519 device identity under `~/.openclaw-go/identity/` and sends a pairing request to the gateway. On the gateway host, run:

```sh
openclaw device list --pending
```

You should see repclaw's device ID. Approve it:

```sh
openclaw device approve <device-id>
```

Then restart repclaw — subsequent connections use the stored device token automatically.

### 3. Start chatting

Select an agent from the list, then start chatting. Press `n` on the agent list to create a new agent.

| Key | Context | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `n` | Agent list | Create a new agent |
| `Enter` | Agent list | Select agent |
| `Enter` | Chat | Send message |
| `Alt+Enter` | Chat | Insert newline |
| `Ctrl+W` | Chat | Delete word |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Chat | Scroll chat history |
| `Esc` | Chat | Back to agent list |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

## Commands

Type these in the chat input. Tab autocompletes partial commands.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/agents` | Return to agent picker |
| `/clear` | Clear chat display |
| `/compact` | Compact session context (with confirmation) |
| `/config` | Open preferences |
| `/model` | List available models |
| `/model <name>` | Switch model (fuzzy match) |
| `/reset` | Delete session and start fresh (with confirmation) |
| `/sessions` | Browse and restore previous sessions |
| `/skills` | List available agent skills |
| `/stats` | Show token usage and cost breakdown |
| `/quit`, `/exit` | Quit repclaw |

## Remote commands

Prefix input with `!` to run a command on the gateway host. The input border turns amber to indicate remote execution mode.

```
!hostname
!ls -la /tmp
!uptime
```

The gateway's exec security policy controls which commands are allowed. If a command is denied, you'll see an error message. Configure exec permissions on the gateway host using `openclaw config`.

## Built on

repclaw uses the [openclaw-go](https://github.com/a3tai/openclaw-go) SDK for gateway communication. The TUI is built with [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles), and [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss), with markdown rendered via [Glamour](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour).

Device identity (Ed25519 keypair) is stored at `~/.openclaw-go/identity/` and shared with other openclaw-go clients.
