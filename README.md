# repclaw

[![CI](https://github.com/outofcoffee/repclaw/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/outofcoffee/repclaw/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A terminal chat client for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/daggerhashimoto/openclaw-nerve). Pick an agent, start talking, see responses stream in live.

## What it does

repclaw connects to your OpenClaw gateway over WebSocket and gives you a clean TUI for chatting with agents. It loads recent conversation history on startup so you have context, and streams responses as they arrive — no waiting for the full reply.

That's it. No file browsers, no task boards, no dashboards. Just chat.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outofcoffee/repclaw/main/install/repclaw.sh | sh
```

Or, if you have Go 1.24+:

```sh
go install github.com/outofcoffee/repclaw@latest
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/outofcoffee/repclaw.git
cd repclaw
go build -o repclaw .
```

## Getting started

### 1. Create an API token on your gateway

Generate an operator token using the OpenClaw CLI on the machine running your gateway:

```sh
openclaw token create --role operator --scopes operator:read,operator:write --name repclaw
```

Copy the token it prints — you'll need it in the next step.

### 2. Configure repclaw

Create a `.env` file in the directory you'll run repclaw from (or export the variables in your shell):

```sh
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-gateway-host
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<token-from-step-1>
```

The gateway URL can use `https`, `http`, `wss`, or `ws` schemes. repclaw derives the WebSocket endpoint automatically.

### 3. Connect and approve the device

```sh
repclaw
```

On first connection, the gateway will prompt you to approve device pairing. On the gateway host, run:

```sh
openclaw device list --pending
```

You should see repclaw's device ID. Approve it:

```sh
openclaw device approve <device-id>
```

Then restart repclaw — subsequent connections will use the paired device identity automatically. The identity (Ed25519 keypair and device token) is stored at `~/.openclaw-go/identity/`.

### 4. Start chatting

Select an agent from the list, then start chatting.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Shift+Enter` | Insert newline |
| `Ctrl+W` | Delete word |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Scroll chat history |
| `Esc` | Back to agent list |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

## Commands

Type these in the chat input. Tab autocompletes partial commands.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/model` | List available models |
| `/model <name>` | Switch model (fuzzy match) |
| `/stats` | Show token usage and cost breakdown |
| `/clear` | Clear chat display |
| `/back` | Return to agent list |
| `/quit` | Quit repclaw |

## How it works

repclaw uses the [openclaw-go](https://github.com/a3tai/openclaw-go) SDK to communicate with the gateway. The TUI is built with [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles), and [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss). Completed responses are rendered as markdown with [Glamour](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour).

Device identity (Ed25519 keypair) is stored at `~/.openclaw-go/identity/` and shared with other openclaw-go clients.
