# repclaw

[![CI](https://github.com/outofcoffee/repclaw/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/outofcoffee/repclaw/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A terminal chat client for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/daggerhashimoto/openclaw-nerve). Pick an agent, start talking, see responses stream in live.

## What it does

repclaw connects to your OpenClaw gateway over WebSocket and gives you a clean TUI for chatting with agents. It loads recent conversation history on startup so you have context, and streams responses as they arrive — no waiting for the full reply.

That's it. No file browsers, no task boards, no dashboards. Just chat.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outofcoffee/repclaw/main/install/repclaw.sh | sh
```

Or, if you have Go 1.24+:

```sh
go install github.com/outofcoffee/repclaw@latest
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/outofcoffee/repclaw.git
cd repclaw
go build -o repclaw .
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file (or set environment variables):

```sh
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-gateway-host
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

The gateway URL can use `https`, `http`, `wss`, or `ws` schemes. repclaw derives the WebSocket endpoint automatically.

On first connection, the gateway may prompt you to approve device pairing. Accept the pairing request, then restart repclaw — subsequent connections will use the paired device identity.

## Usage

```sh
repclaw
```

Select an agent from the list, then start chatting.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Shift+Enter` | Insert newline |
| `Esc` | Back to agent list |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

## How it works

repclaw uses the [openclaw-go](https://github.com/a3tai/openclaw-go) SDK to communicate with the gateway. The TUI is built with [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles), and [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss). Completed responses are rendered as markdown with [Glamour](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour).

Device identity (Ed25519 keypair) is stored at `~/.openclaw-go/identity/` and shared with other openclaw-go clients.
